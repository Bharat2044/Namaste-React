# Types of testing (developer)

- Unit Testing - Testing One Component in Isolation || means seperately
- Integration Testing - Testing Integration of Components
- End to End Testing (or) E2E Testing - End-to-end testing verifies that all components of a system can run under real-world scenarios. The goal of this form of testing is to simulate a user experience from start to finish. E2E testing can find software dependencies while also validating the system under test, its data integrity and integrations.

# Setting up Testing in our app

## Ques): What are the difference types of Testing?

**Ans.** In React development, various types of testing ensure that components and applications work correctly.

Here are some common types of testing in React:

### Unit Testing

- **Purpose**: Test individual components or functions in isolation.
- **Tools**: Jest, Mocha, Chai.
- **Example**: Testing if a function correctly returns the expected output given specific inputs.

### Component Testing

- **Purpose**: Test the rendering and behavior of React components.
- **Tools**: React Testing Library, Enzyme.
- **Example**: Checking if a component renders correctly based on its props and state.

### Integration Testing

- **Purpose**: Test the interaction between multiple components or services.
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress.
- **Example**: Ensuring that data fetched from an API is correctly passed to and displayed by a component.

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Purpose**: Test the entire application workflow from the user’s perspective.
- **Tools**: Cypress, Selenium, Puppeteer.
- **Example**: Simulating a user logging in, navigating through the app, and verifying that the expected elements are displayed.

### Snapshot Testing

- **Purpose**: Test that a component’s output does not change unexpectedly.
- **Tools**: Jest (with built-in snapshot testing).
- **Example**: Capturing the rendered output of a component and comparing it to a stored snapshot to detect unintended changes.

### Performance Testing

- **Purpose**: Test the performance of components and the application as a whole.
- **Tools**: Lighthouse, React Profiler.
- **Example**: Measuring render times and optimizing components for better performance.

### Static Testing

- **Purpose**: Analyze code for potential errors without executing it.
- **Tools**: ESLint, TypeScript (for type checking).
- **Example**: Linting code to enforce coding standards and detect syntax errors.

## Ques): React Testing Library and It's set up

**Ans.** React Testing Library is a popular tool for testing React components, focusing on testing components from the user's perspective. It encourages best practices by emphasizing testing the behavior of components rather than their implementation details.

### Key Features

- **User-Centric**: Tests are written in a way that resembles how users interact with the application.
- **Simplicity**: Provides a simple API that integrates well with Jest.
- **Best Practices**: Encourages writing tests that are easy to maintain and understand.

### Installation

To use React Testing Library, you need to install it along with Jest (if you haven't already). You can install it using npm or yarn:

- **Using npm**

  ```bash
  npm install --save @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
  ```

- **Using yarn**
  ```sh
  yarn add @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
  ```

### Setup

After installing the necessary packages, you need to set up Jest to use React Testing Library. Follow these steps:

1. **Configure Jest**: Ensure Jest is set up in your project. If you're using Create React App, Jest is already configured for you.

2. **Create a Setup File**: Create a setup file to include additional configurations for React Testing Library. This file is typically named `setupTests.js`.

   ```js
   // setupTests.js
   import "@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect";
   ```

3. **Update Jest Configuration**: Ensure your Jest configuration includes the setup file. If you're using Create React App, it automatically picks up `setupTests.js`. If you have a custom Jest configuration, add the setup file path to the `setupFilesAfterEnv` array in your `jest.config.js` file:

   ```js
   // jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/src/setupTests.js"],
     // Other Jest configurations...
   };
   ```

### Writing Tests

Here are some examples of how to write tests using React Testing Library:

#### Rendering a Component

```js
import React from "react";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import App from "./App";

test("renders learn react link", () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

#### Interacting with Elements

```js
import React from "react";
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import Counter from "./Counter";

test("increments counter", () => {
  render(<Counter />);
  const button = screen.getByText(/increment/i);
  fireEvent.click(button);
  const counter = screen.getByText(/count: 1/i);
  expect(counter).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Best Practices

- **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on how the component behaves from the user's perspective.
- **Use Queries Appropriately**: Prefer queries like `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, and `getByText` which reflect how users interact with the app.
- **Avoid Direct State Manipulation**: Avoid testing implementation details such as internal state directly. Test the UI and behavior.

By following these steps and best practices, you can effectively use React Testing Library to write reliable and maintainable tests for your React components.

  test("fetches data successfully", async () => {
    fetchData.mockResolvedValue({ data: "some data" });
    const data = await fetchData();
    expect(data).toEqual({ data: "some data" });
  });
  ```

### Running Tests

To run tests, add a script to your package.json:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

Then, run the tests with:

```sh
npm test
```

**or**

```sh
yarn test
```

- **Basic Component Test**

  ```js
  import React from "react";
  import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
  import App from "./App";

  test("renders learn react link", () => {
    render(<App />);
    const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
    expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  ```

- **Snapshot Test**

  ```js
  import React from "react";
  import renderer from "react-test-renderer";
  import App from "./App";

  test("renders correctly", () => {
    const tree = renderer.create(<App />).toJSON();
    expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
  ```

- **Mocking with Jest**

  ```js
  const fetchData = require("./fetchData");

  jest.mock("./fetchData");

  test("fetches data successfully", async () => {
    fetchData.mockResolvedValue({ data: "some data" });
    const data = await fetchData();
    expect(data).toEqual({ data: "some data" });
  });
  ```

### Running Tests

To run your tests, use the following command:

- **Using npm**

  ```sh
  npm test
  ```
