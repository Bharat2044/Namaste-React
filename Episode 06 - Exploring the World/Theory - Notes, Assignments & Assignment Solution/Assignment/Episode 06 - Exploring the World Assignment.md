# _Episode 06 - Exploring the World_


## Theory Assignment:
- What is `Microservice`?
- What is `Monolith architecture`?
- What is the `difference` between `Monolith and Microservice?
- Why do we need a `useEffect Hook`?
- What is `Optional Chaining`?
- What is `Shimmer UI`?
- What is the `difference` between `JS expression and JS statement`?
- What is `Conditional Rendering`? explain with a code example.
- What is `CORS`?
- What is `async and await`?
- What is the use of `const json = await data.json()`; in `getRestaurants()`?

## Coding Assignment:
- Play with the `useEffect Hook` to see when it is called? (before or after render)
- Play with the `dependency array` in useEffect Hook.
- Play with the `developer console` by putting a `debugger` in render and `useEffect`.
- Call an `actual API call`.
- `Handle Error` in your `API call`.
- Build `Shimmer UI` when `data is not loaded`.
- `Render your UI` with `actual API data`.
- Make `Search functionality` work.
- Make a `Login Logout` button that `toggles with a state`.
