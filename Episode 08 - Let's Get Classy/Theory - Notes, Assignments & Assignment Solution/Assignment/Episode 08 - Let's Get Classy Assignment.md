# _Episode 08 - Let's Get Classy_


## Theory Assignment:
- How do you create `Nested Routes react-router-dom` configuration?
- Read about `createHashRouter`, `createMemoryRouter` from React Router docs.
- What is the `order of life cycle method calls` in `Class Based Components`?
- Why do we use `componentDidMount`?
- Why do we use `componentWillUnmount`? Show with `example`.
- (Research) Why do we use `super(props)` in `constructor`?
- (Research) Why `can't we have` the `callback function` of `useEffect async`?


## Coding Assignment:
- Create `Class Based` Component.
    - Create 2 `class-based child components`.
    - `Pass props` from `Parent to child`.
    - Create a `constructor`.
    - Create a `state variable` inside child.
    - Use `this.setState` to update it.
    - What if there are `multiple state variables`?
    - Write a `console.log` for each lifecycle method.
    - Play with the `console logs` to find out the `correct order of their execution`.
- Create `interval` inside `componentDidMount`?
    - Use `clearInterval` to `fix the issue` caused by the `interval`
